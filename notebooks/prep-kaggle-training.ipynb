    "   - Calculate relative weights based on funding amounts\n",

    "   - Project pairs are always stored with alphabetically larger URL first\n",
    "   - When the same pair appears in multiple rounds, weights are averaged\n",
    "   - Weights for each pair sum to 1.0\n",

    "If Project A received 75 and Project B received 25 in a round:\n",
    "- weight_a = 0.75 (75/100)\n",
    "- weight_b = 0.25 (25/100)\n",
